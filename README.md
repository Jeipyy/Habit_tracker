A backend development project focused on practicing relational database management and system architecture. This repository serves as a practical laboratory to consolidate core concepts of Informatics Engineering through active learning and project-based development.

## Project Objectives
The primary goal of this system is to bridge the gap between theoretical database concepts and practical implementation. Key areas of focus include:
* Relational data modeling using PostgreSQL.
* Implementation of data integrity through foreign keys and cascading actions.
* Version control and documentation best practices.

## Technical Stack
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Language: SQL (DDL and DML)
* Management: Git / GitHub

## System Architecture
The database is structured to handle various aspects of habit tracking and user data management:
1. Users: Management of unique user profiles and authentication data.
2. Habits: Definition of user-specific goals with configurable tracking frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly).
3. Logs: Historical records of habit execution.
4. Notes: A dedicated space for progress documentation and technical reflections.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the /database directory.
3. Run tables.sql to initialize the schema structure.
4. (Optional) Run test.sql to populate the database with sample data for verification.
